# Ansible-Playbook-SSH-key-creator
This Ansible playbook automates the creation of SSH key pairs. It prompts the user for necessary details, checks if an SSH key already exists for the given host, and generates a new SSH key pair if it does not exist. This playbook is useful for system administrators and developers who need to set up secure SSH access for their systems.
